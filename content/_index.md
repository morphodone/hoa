### Slow Down in Our Alleys

Dear Village at MacArthur Commons Home Owners:

In our last HOA Annual Meeting, we discussed the traffic in our alleys and some residents expressed concern with the speed of drivers who use the alleys.   You may notice that there are new signs up at each alley entrance to remind everyone that they need to SLOW DOWN.

Due to foot traffic in the alleys and the blind driveways we all have, a car driving at an excessive speed down the alley is a safety hazard for us all.  Please ask all the drivers in your household to slow down as they move through our alleys.  Let's all be safe and take care as we motor down these tight spaces!
